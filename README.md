# Cluedo
A text input adventure game based on Cluedo in C++ for a course.

The final lab in an in-depth C++ course. 

The goal was to create a text based adventure game to display an understanding of the concepts of C++ and the 2011 standard.

Some solutions are created just to show that I knew about dynamic memory management, lambda functions, function pointers etc.
